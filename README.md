# NASA_APOD
NASA_APOD - simple wallpaper app using NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day resources. 

* grab current image and set it as desktop wallpaper
* auto-refresh your image
* save images to disk
* browse through the archive

Below TODOs still needs some work:
* save HD image to disk, but use regular res in GUI to reduce mem usage - sometimes HD version are really large
* wallpaper setting sometimes fails in Windows 7 - why?
* grab whole archive - still 'experimental', not fully tested
